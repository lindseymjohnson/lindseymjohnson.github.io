This is a project I created from a GitHub fork. I recommend checking out Jekyll for layouts and source codes you can customize for your own personal resume. The original creator of this theme is listed below as well as their mentor on the project. Some of my editing is thanks to my wonderful husband who is an <a href="http://legacy.codes">software engineer with his own personal webage</a>.
